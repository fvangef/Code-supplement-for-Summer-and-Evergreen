Abstractâ€”Circumboreal forests, covering about 30% of global forested areas, are undergoing significant climate-induced changes. In Eastern Siberia, global warming may shift the boreal forest transition zone, replacing summergreen larch with evergreen needleleaf species. To monitor these changes, we trained a Random Forest classifier to map summergreen and evergreen forests using the SiDroForest Sentinel-2 dataset. This dataset, informed by expert field knowledge, includes nearly two million pixels across early, peak, and late summer phenophases.
Feature importance analysis highlighted the Sentinel-2 long shortwave infrared band (B12) as crucial for distinguishing forest types in all seasons, likely due to moisture content differences. Additional key features include the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and red band (B4) in early summer, shortwave bands and the blue band in peak summer, and B12, the near-infrared band (B8), and NDVI in late summer.
Validation with the SiDroTest dataset, linked to in-situ forest plots, showed accuracies of 63% for early summer, 89% for peak summer, and 99% for late summer, with an average accuracy of 82% across all seasons. The classifier performed best in late summer, leveraging distinct spectral differences between evergreen forests' greenness and the seasonal coloring of summergreen larch forests. This method provides a precise tool for mapping boreal forest types in the Siberian transition zone, particularly effective in late summer when these differences are most evident.
